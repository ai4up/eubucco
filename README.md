# EUBUCCO

This is the repository for the EUBUCCO project. This repo contains the code for the buildings database and the energy model. 

Most of our functions for geo-spatial data processing are located in the UFO-MAP [repo](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/nikolami/ufo-map). This repo builds on the work from one of our previous project, see repo [here](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/nikolami/learning-from-urban-form-to-predict-building-heights).
